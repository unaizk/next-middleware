 While only one middleware.ts file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate .ts or .js files and import them into your main middleware.ts file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the middleware.ts for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.
